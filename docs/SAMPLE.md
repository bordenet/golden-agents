# Sample Generated Output

This shows what Golden Agents generates for a Python web application project.

## Progressive Mode (~60 lines) — Default

Progressive mode is the default and recommended approach. It generates a minimal core with
on-demand template loading from `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/`.

```bash
./generate-agents.sh --language=python --type=web-apps --path=./my-api
```

Progressive mode generates ~60 lines of high-signal guidance that AI assistants can actually follow,
with instructions to load detailed templates only when needed for specific tasks.

---

## Compact Mode (~130 lines)

Compact mode provides self-contained guidance without external dependencies.

```bash
./generate-agents.sh --language=python --type=web-apps --compact --path=./my-api
```

### Generated Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Agents.md` | Primary guidance file (shown below) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Redirect for Claude Code |
| `CODEX.md` | Redirect for OpenAI Codex CLI |
| `AGENT.md` | Redirect for Amp by Sourcegraph |
| `GEMINI.md` | Redirect for Google Gemini |
| `COPILOT.md` | Redirect for GitHub Copilot |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot custom instructions |

**Note:** You can safely delete any redirect files for AI assistants you don't use.

## Workflow Checklists

### Optional: Enhanced Workflows

If you have [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) installed, run at session start:

```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js bootstrap
```

Superpowers provides interactive skill-based workflows. If not installed, use the checklists below.

### Before Creative/Feature Work

- [ ] Clarify the problem being solved
- [ ] Identify acceptance criteria and success metrics
- [ ] Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Explore 2-3 approaches with trade-offs

### Before Implementation (TDD Cycle)

- [ ] Write failing test describing desired behavior
- [ ] Implement minimal code to pass test
- [ ] Refactor for clarity and consistency
- [ ] Verify all existing tests still pass

### Before Claiming Done

- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] No linting errors or warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated if behavior changed

## Communication Standards

- **No flattery** - Skip "Great question!" or "Excellent point!"
- **No hype words** - Avoid "revolutionary", "game-changing", "cutting-edge"
- **Evidence-based** - Cite sources, provide data, or qualify as opinion
- **Direct** - State facts without embellishment

### Banned Phrases

| Category | Avoid |
|----------|-------|
| Self-Promotion | production-grade, world-class, enterprise-ready |
| Filler | incredibly, extremely, very, really, truly |
| AI Tells | leverage, utilize, facilitate, streamline, optimize |
| Sycophancy | Happy to help!, Absolutely!, I appreciate... |

## Quality Gates

### Before Committing

1. **Lint**: `pylint --fail-under=9.5 .`
2. **Build**: `mypy .`
3. **Test**: `pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing`
4. **Coverage**: Minimum 80%

### Before Pushing

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Commit messages are descriptive

---

## Language Quick Reference

### Python

- Run `pylint --fail-under=9.5` and `mypy` before committing
- Type annotations required for all public functions
- Use `pytest` with `--cov` for coverage

---

## Quick Commands

# Lint
pylint --fail-under=9.5 .

# Build
mypy .

# Test
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing

## Full Mode (~800 lines) — DEPRECATED

> ⚠️ **DEPRECATED in v1.4.2** — Full mode generates 800+ line files that AI assistants cannot follow.
> Use progressive mode (default) or compact mode instead.

Full mode is available via `--full` but prints a deprecation warning:

```bash
./generate-agents.sh --language=python --type=web-apps --full --path=./my-api
# [WARN] DEPRECATED: --full generates 800+ line files that AI assistants cannot follow.
```

If you need detailed guidance for specific tasks, use progressive mode and load templates on-demand
from `$HOME/.golden-agents/templates/`.

---

## Redirect Files

Each redirect file contains a simple pointer:

```markdown
# Claude Code Instructions

See **[Agents.md](./Agents.md)** for all AI guidance.
```

This ensures all AI assistants find and follow the same guidance.
