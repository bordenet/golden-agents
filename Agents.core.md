## Workflow Checklists

### Optional: Enhanced Workflows

If [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) is installed, run at session start:

```bash
node ~/.codex/superpowers-augment/superpowers-augment.js bootstrap
```

Otherwise, use the checklists below.

### Before Creative/Feature Work

- [ ] Clarify the problem being solved
- [ ] Identify acceptance criteria
- [ ] Explore 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
- [ ] Document decision rationale

### Before Implementation (TDD)

- [ ] Write failing test first
- [ ] Implement minimal code to pass
- [ ] Refactor for clarity
- [ ] Verify all tests pass

### When Debugging

- [ ] Gather error information
- [ ] Form hypothesis before changing code
- [ ] Test with minimal change
- [ ] Add regression test

### Before Claiming Done

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Communication Standards

- **No flattery** - Skip "Great question!" or "Excellent point!"
- **No hype words** - Avoid "revolutionary", "game-changing", "cutting-edge"
- **Evidence-based** - Cite sources, provide data, or qualify as opinion
- **Direct** - State facts without embellishment

### Banned Phrases

| Category | Avoid |
|----------|-------|
| Self-Promotion | production-grade, world-class, enterprise-ready |
| Filler | incredibly, extremely, very, really, truly |
| AI Tells | leverage, utilize, facilitate, streamline, optimize |
| Sycophancy | Happy to help!, Absolutely!, I appreciate... |

## Quality Gates

### Before Committing

1. **Lint**: `golangci-lint run ./...`
2. **Build**: `go build ./...`
3. **Test**: `go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`
4. **Coverage**: Minimum 80%

### Before Pushing

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Commit messages are descriptive

### Before Deploying

- [ ] CI shows green checkmark
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Documentation updated

---

## Language Quick Reference

### Go

- Run `golangci-lint run ./...` then `go build ./...` before committing
- 80% test coverage minimum with table-driven tests
- Error handling: wrap with context, no naked returns
- Use `context.Context` for cancellation/timeouts

### Python

- Type annotations required on all public functions
- pylint score ≥9.5, mypy strict mode
- Use dataclasses for DTOs, Pydantic for validation
- Virtual environments mandatory

### JavaScript

- ESLint + Prettier, 2-space indent
- Prefer TypeScript for new code
- async/await over callbacks
- No console.log in production code

### Shell

- Start with `set -euo pipefail`
- shellcheck must pass
- Use BSD-compatible flags for macOS
- Quote all variables: "$var"


---

## Context Management

- **Context rot**: Model accuracy degrades as context fills. Keep tokens high-signal.
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load Agents.md always, modules on-demand, code just-in-time.
- **Compact at 75%**: Summarize history, keep decisions, drop exploration.
- **Session resume**: Check `git log -5`, `git status`, load notes before proceeding.
